```

## Local Environment

### Installation

Install all the required dependencies from `package.json`:

```
yarn install
```

### Build

Compile `.ts` to `.js`:

```
yarn build
```

### Run

Run via `node.js`:

```
yarn start
```

## Alerting

### BetterUptime

BetterUptime is used for alerting and incident management.

- Heartbeats are sent every minute for `Health` and `Sync Status` of the nodes
- Missed heartbeats create incidents
- Kubernetes pod restarts create incidents
- High slash points create incidents
- Jailing creates incidents
- Lagging chain observations create incidents
- Outdated THORChain versions creates incidents

#### API Key

## Logging (optional)

### Logtail

Logtail can be optionally used for log manangement.

If `LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN` is set in the environment variables:
- VÇ«rÃ°r forwards its own logs to Logtail
- VÇ«rÃ°r aggregates and forwards the logs of all chains to Logtail

#### Source Token

Sign up at [logtail.com](https://logtail.com), go to `Sources`, add a new `Source` with `JavaScript` as the platform and get the `Source Token`.
